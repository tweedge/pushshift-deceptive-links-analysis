# pushshift-deceptive-links-analysis

Once upon a time, I noticed an affiliate marketer on Reddit that adopted a trick from phishing to try to drive more traffic to their site. They would pretend to be helpful by linking to "docs" (say, `https://example.org/docs`) but the actual link included went to their own domain (say, `https://shitbag.lol/example`). They would add affiliate tags and push you through to the site - quietly reaping affiliate commissions.

This is hilariously honest - not that *they* were being honest, but that they knew this was unwelcome and had to result to *phishing tactics* to trick people into clicking. Affiliate marketing is just the worst - and they know it too.

So, I decided to look into all deceptive links on Reddit - links whose text says `[site a]` but actually direct you to `[site b]`.

Dumps soon(tm).
